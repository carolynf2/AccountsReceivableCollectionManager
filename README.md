## Usage Guide

### Customer Management
```python
# Add a new customer
customer_data = {
    'customer_name': 'ABC Company',
    'email': 'billing@abc.com',
    'credit_limit': 25000,
    'risk_rating': 'MEDIUM'
}
customer_id = customer_manager.add_customer(customer_data)
```

### Invoice Management
```python
# Create an invoice
invoice_data = {
    'customer_id': 1,
    'invoice_number': 'INV-001',
    'invoice_date': date(2024, 1, 15),
    'due_date': date(2024, 2, 14),
    'amount': 5000.00
}
invoice_id = invoice_manager.add_invoice(invoice_data)
```

### Payment Processing
```python
# Record a payment
payment_data = {
    'invoice_id': 1,
    'payment_date': date.today(),
    'amount': 2500.00,
    'payment_method': 'CHECK',
    'reference_number': 'CHK-12345'
}
payment_id = payment_manager.add_payment(payment_data)
```

### Collection Activities
```python
# Log collection activity
activity_data = {
    'customer_id': 1,
    'activity_type': 'CALL',
    'outcome': 'PROMISE_TO_PAY',
    'notes': 'Customer promised payment by Friday',
    'follow_up_date': date.today() + timedelta(days=3)
}
activity_id = activity_manager.add_activity(activity_data)
```

### Priority Calculation
```python
# Get prioritized customer list
prioritizer = CollectionPrioritizer(db_manager)
priority_list = prioritizer.get_prioritized_collection_list(limit=20)

# Get collection recommendations
recommendations = prioritizer.get_collection_recommendations(customer_id)
```

### Efficiency Analysis
```python
# Generate efficiency report
calculator = CollectionEfficiencyCalculator(db_manager)
report = calculator.generate_efficiency_report(start_date, end_date)

print(f"Collection Rate: {report['collection_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"DSO: {report['days_sales_outstanding']:.1f} days")
```

## Priority Scoring Algorithm

The system calculates priority scores based on five weighted factors:

1. **Days Overdue** (Weight: 2.0)
   - 2 points per day overdue
   - Capped at 100 points maximum

2. **Outstanding Amount** (Weight: 1.5)
   - Logarithmic scale: log10(amount) Ã— 10
   - Gives appropriate weight to large balances

3. **Risk Rating** (Weight: 1.8)
   - LOW: 10 points
   - MEDIUM: 50 points  
   - HIGH: 100 points

4. **Broken Promises** (Weight: 2.5)
   - 20 points per broken promise
   - Heavily penalizes unreliable customers

5. **Last Contact Date** (Weight: 1.2)
   - 2 points per day since last contact
   - Encourages regular customer communication

**Final Score = Î£(Factor Score Ã— Weight)**

## Collection Recommendations

The system provides specific, actionable recommendations:

- **CRITICAL** (Score > 500): Legal proceedings consideration
- **HIGH PRIORITY** (Score 300-500): Daily contact attempts
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Score 150-300): Contact within 3-5 days
- **LOW PRIORITY** (Score < 150): Standard collection process

Additional context-specific recommendations cover:
- Aging-based escalations
- Risk-based credit decisions
- Contact frequency adjustments
- Amount-based executive involvement

## Efficiency Metrics

### Collection Rate
Percentage of receivables collected over a time period:
```
Collection Rate = (Collections in Period / Starting Receivables) Ã— 100
```

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Average number of days to collect receivables:
```
DSO = Current Receivables / (Sales in Last 90 Days / 90)
```

### Promise Keeping Rate
Reliability of customer payment commitments:
```
Promise Rate = (Promises Kept / Total Promises) Ã— 100
```

### Contact Success Rate
Effectiveness of collection activities:
```
Success Rate = (Successful Contacts / Total Activities) Ã— 100
```
